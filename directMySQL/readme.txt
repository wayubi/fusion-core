Installation:
-------------
 This is not a component so do *NOT* try to install it as a component. These are 
objects and they do need to be created/freed in an explicit manner.
Check the demo to see how to create/free them.
 This is a beta version which means there are no know bugs, but there may be.
 If you want to use ssl you will need to find/build openssl and you will need to
redistribute libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll with your executable. 

Note: - ssl has not been tested with kylix. I would appreciate if anyone has time to 
build mysql 4.0 on linux and try to connect to it from kylix (yes i'm still working 
on that laptop so it will take me like forever to install/reinstall everything in order
to debug both windows and kylix - so for the moment i can *only* assume it works with
kylix)
      - i finally got some time to comment each function/procedure so please do check 
the source code for comments.

News:
-----
- by accident pipes werent working on linux; now this is fixed
- invalid resultset when a row is empty and there is just a column!! 
- connect now do really has a timed out! (very nice on errors). Check ConnectTimeout 
propertie for the value(default 30)
- read has a time-out !!! very nice fature .. your app will recover nicely on network
errors while reading a large dataset
- new porperty NoTimeOut which disables the read-checks time-out. Will increase the speed
on reliable connetions (do not enable it if you are not sure what you are doing)
- the code has been rearranged in order to make it more reliable and to handle the errors
better/faster
- many thanks to all users of this library for sugestions on how to improve it. I'm 
looking forward for hear anymore sugestions.
- i'm still LOOKING FOR A JOB .. so if you need someone or if you know someone who may need
a delphi p/a please do not hesitate to contact me.

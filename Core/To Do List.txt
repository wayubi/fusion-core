1-26-04: TODO for 1.2.0.9 [Colus]

OK, let's make a list.  I assume we're planning a release around 2-1-2004.
Here are some things that I *know* we want to iron out before releasing.

Core: 

- Pet crashes/lag/data duplications (bug #314)

- Monster skill crashes/bugs (if they exist!) (350, others)
  * Fix order of casting (skill *after* cast timer)
  * Get all skills in if possible
  * Fix hide leading to unhittable, crittastic monsters (bug 339)

- Check out status effects and correct them if needed
  (This is needed for things like lex A)

- As many skill fixes as is reasonable

- Limits on multipliers for XP, party distribution, drops...

- Correct HP/SP regen rates to kRO standard

12-23-03: Just a thought [Darkhelmet]


All Right Guys. I don't know why we are discussing this here.
There is a bugtracker at http://bugtracker.izlude.net for discussing bugs, assigning priority, etc.

Let's move over there.

This is only a To Do List of Ideas. General concepts, not fine details.

There should be no more posts to this. Post responses and continuations on the bugtracker if you have to.

--------------------------

    Ok, I will try to make this easy to understand. There are many bugs dealing with map issues.

    I found out that the problem was the maps were not loaded properly in the source code.

    Harbinger based his DWM maps on the source code. Therefore Harbinger's maps contained the bug IN them
    because they were NOT properly converted.

    I fixed the bug in the source code and made new maps which are 100% identical to GAT (minus data
    that we dont need).

    This does not ALL bugs have been fixed.  Even though the AFMs are 100% A-OK, there are MORE bugs in the
    source (does this surprise anyone). Just because some things dont work (like Teleport gets you stuck)
    doesn't mean the AFMs are bad. It means there are more bugs to fix in the source.

    For example, after I made AFM, You could still walk through IceWall.  I edited the code, so now it works.
    This means to fix IceWall I needed 2 things. A) Fix the Mapload source. B) Make new bug-less maps.
    C) Fix the IceWall code.

    Got It? The AFM Maps are FINE!

- Tweak New Map Format (con't)
  - I don't understand--are you saying the .gat source, or the code source?  If it's code source
    then we need to fix that, for certain, before releasing.  I didn't see any obvious problem,
    but I haven't seen the new map format exploded yet either.  Athena uses...whatever they use,
    I suppose the actual .gats, and doesn't have the problem.  If these are straight .gat ports
    then we should be fine to fix this. (Colus)

- 2-2 skill requirements (high)
  - Someone (eliot?) added requirements in the second set of required skills for the 2-2 classes.
    This is all fine, but right now a monk/aco can't learn anything with the latest skill DB until
    someone fixes how requirements are read.  And I only tried the one class out.  If this is
    going in, it also needs to be fixed today. (Colus)

- Drop Rate options (low)
  - First of all: ItemDropMultiplier works.  number = drop multiplier.  2 = 2x, 3 = 3x, 100 = 100x...
  - I am flexible on this.  The current idea was to drop ItemDropDenominator from the options and have
    one prop, DropRate or DropPercentage as you like.  It would default to 100 (%), so you can have 1%
    drops or 10000% or whatever.  It would be n, in this equation.

    denominator = denominator * 10000 div (n * 100)

    More boring math, I know.  When I mentioned this idea somebody told me Athena is already doing
    this method (I guess their users are also algebra-deficient like ours).  So it's not original,
    but it would be cleaner.

    ItemDropPer would become something else, but it would still have the ugly 10000 format.  The
    effects are not linear, therefore it's not so easy to choose a format.  It could be called
    DropRareAdjustment or something.  <shrug>

[Suggestions by Darkhelmet]

- Monster Skills
- Tweak New Map Format <-- (what do you mean, tweak?) (Alex)
	- alex monsters are spawning in walls, and going through them many reports on it today(Oatmeal)
	- oat, this is not a bug with the maps.. this is a bug with the source.. just like icewall and flywing...
	  its basically 2 bugs in one. 1 bug was fixed with new maps, but for full fix, the source must be fixed
	  for THAT section. If there is anything wrong with maps NOW, then I can do nothing because it is
	  identical to GATs.  However, they can be edited manually using notepad. (Alex)


- Guild Wars  (Low priority)
- Update Triple blow (low priority)
- Update Item Db (high Priortity)
	- i'm working on it-(oatmeal)
	- get elliot to help you. he's a DB Maintainer. (Alex).

- Wedding System (Low Priority)
- GM commands #ban , #kick (very helpful) [Eliot]
- Mercenary Monsters .. Talk to Paradox (Alex)


<-- we have "-kick username" or "-kick username global" but not for ingame only console (Alex)
<-- for ban I just do -sql update chara set password = xxx where username = yyy .. but -ban is good (Alex)

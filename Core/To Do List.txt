- Tweak New Map Format (con't)
  - I don't understand--are you saying the .gat source, or the code source?  If it's code source
    then we need to fix that, for certain, before releasing.  I didn't see any obvious problem,
    but I haven't seen the new map format exploded yet either.  Athena uses...whatever they use,
    I suppose the actual .gats, and doesn't have the problem.  If these are straight .gat ports
    then we should be fine to fix this. (Colus)

- 2-2 skill requirements (high)
  - Someone (eliot?) added requirements in the second set of required skills for the 2-2 classes.
    This is all fine, but right now a monk/aco can't learn anything with the latest skill DB until
    someone fixes how requirements are read.  And I only tried the one class out.  If this is
    going in, it also needs to be fixed today. (Colus)

- Drop Rate options (low)
  - First of all: ItemDropMultiplier works.  number = drop multiplier.  2 = 2x, 3 = 3x, 100 = 100x...
  - I am flexible on this.  The current idea was to drop ItemDropDenominator from the options and have
    one prop, DropRate or DropPercentage as you like.  It would default to 100 (%), so you can have 1%
    drops or 10000% or whatever.  It would be n, in this equation.

    denominator = denominator * 10000 div (n * 100)

    More boring math, I know.  When I mentioned this idea somebody told me Athena is already doing
    this method (I guess their users are also algebra-deficient like ours).  So it's not original,
    but it would be cleaner.

    ItemDropPer would become something else, but it would still have the ugly 10000 format.  The
    effects are not linear, therefore it's not so easy to choose a format.  It could be called
    DropRareAdjustment or something.  <shrug>

[Suggestions by Darkhelmet]

- Monster Skills
- Tweak New Map Format <-- (what do you mean, tweak?) (Alex)
	- alex monsters are spawning in walls, and going through them many reports on it today(Oatmeal)
	- oat, this is not a bug with the maps.. this is a bug with the source.. just like icewall and flywing...
	  its basically 2 bugs in one. 1 bug was fixed with new maps, but for full fix, the source must be fixed
	  for THAT section. If there is anything wrong with maps NOW, then I can do nothing because it is
	  identical to GATs.  However, they can be edited manually using notepad. (Alex)


- Guild Wars  (Low priority)
- Update Triple blow (low priority)
- Update Item Db (high Priortity)
	- i'm working on it-(oatmeal)
	- get elliot to help you. he's a DB Maintainer. (Alex).

- Wedding System (Low Priority)
- GM commands #ban , #kick (very helpful) [Eliot]
- Mercenary Monsters .. Talk to Paradox (Alex)


<-- we have "-kick username" or "-kick username global" but not for ingame only console (Alex)
<-- for ban I just do -sql update chara set password = xxx where username = yyy .. but -ban is good (Alex)
